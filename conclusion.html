    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Conservation efforts in Yosemite National Park are complex and dynamic,
      with multiple stakeholders competing for power and influence over
      decision-making processes related to the park's preservation. The
      theoretical framework of Governmentality provides insight into the power
      dynamics at play in conservation efforts, highlighting power imbalances
      and inequities that exist among stakeholders.</p>
    <p>To promote effective and equitable conservation efforts, it is essential
      to acknowledge and address these power imbalances and inequities. This
      can be achieved through increased engagement with indigenous communities,
      ensuring that their voices and perspectives are included in
      decision-making processes. Furthermore, increased collaboration between
      stakeholders can promote more equitable and effective decision-making
      processes, ensuring that all interests are represented and prioritized in
      conservation efforts.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, the conservation of Yosemite National Park is a vital
      undertaking that requires ongoing attention and collaboration among
      stakeholders. Through a better understanding of the power dynamics at
      play in conservation efforts, we can promote more effective and equitable
      decision-making processes that ensure the park's preservation for future
      generations.</p>
