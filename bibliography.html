    <p>Deur, D., & James Jr, J. E. (2018). Cultivating the Imagined Wilderness:
      Contested Native American Plant-Gathering<br>&emsp;&emsp;Traditions in
      America's National Parks (Vol. 21). University of Arizona Press. Chapter 13.</p>
    <p>Chapter 13 of "Cultivating the Imaged Wilderness" explains the
      collaborative management strategies between Native American communities
      and national park agencies in regards to plant resource management. Deur
      and James highlight the pros and cons, including improved communication
      and shared decision-making, and the need for mutual trust and respect in
      successful partnerships.</p>
    <p>I used this source to highlight the importance of including Indigenous
      voices in the decision-making process of the park. Yosemite's
      conservation efforts must recognize and respect Indigenous peoples'
      rights and perspectives. The article provided evidence for why this is
      important and helped me to articulate the need for a new paradigm in
      conservation that integrates Indigenous knowledge and perspectives.

    <p>This source is a radio program that aired on KPCC that discusses the
        debate surrounding the effects of logging on reforestation near Yosemite
        National Park. The Trump administration called for increased logging in
        the area to reduce the risk of wildfires, but critics argue that this
        could harm the natural environment and wildlife habitats. The discussion
        includes input from experts and stakeholders on both sides of the issue.</p>
    <p>I used this source to provide an example of how political ideologies can
      influence decision-making processes involving the conservation of national
      parks.</p> <br>

    <p>Michel Foucault's essay "The Subject and Power" explores the concept of
      power and its relationship to the subject. He argues that power is not
      just something possessed by individuals or groups, but is embedded in
      social relationships and structures. Foucault suggests that power is not
      something that can be seized or given up, but is constantly in flux and
      produced through various social practices and discourses.</p>
    <p>I used Foucault's ideas about power to analyze the ways in which power
      operates in society. Governmentality is used to influence and shape
    conservation efforts in Yosemite National Park, highlighting the complex
  and dynamic nature of power relations between the state, private organizations,
and local communities. By recognizing the pervasive nature of power relations,
we can better understand the challenges and opportunities for promoting sustainable
and equitable outcomes in conservation efforts.</p> <br>

    <p>The National Park Foundation provides information on Yosemite National
      Park, which is located in California's Sierra Nevada mountains. The park
      is known for its stunning natural features, including waterfalls, cliffs,
      and granite domes, as well as its diverse wildlife. Visitors can enjoy a
      variety of activities, such as hiking, camping, rock climbing, and
      skiing. The park also offers educational opportunities for people of all
      ages to learn about the natural history and cultural significance of the
      area.</p>

    <p>The National Park Service website provides an overview of the natural
      resources found within Yosemite National Park. The page includes
      information about the park's geology, climate, flora, and fauna. It also
      discusses the impact of human activity on the park's ecosystems and
      provides information on conservation efforts.</p>
    <p>I used this source to gather information on the natural resources found
      within Yosemite National Park, including its unique geology, diverse
      wildlife, and fragile ecosystems. The source helped me to understand the
      importance of preserving these resources and the impact that human
      activity can have on them.</p> <br>
