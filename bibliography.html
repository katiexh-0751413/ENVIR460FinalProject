    <p>Bishop, K. (2018). Indigenous peoples, national parks, and protected
      areas: A new paradigm linking conservation, culture, &emsp;&emsp;and rights.
      Environmental Ethics, 40(4), 433-449. doi: 10.5840/enviroethics201840435</p>
    <p>This article explores the connection between Indigenous peoples,
      conservation, and protected areas. It argues that the traditional approach
      to conservation has often ignored Indigenous peoples' rights and
      perspectives, leading to conflict and even the displacement of Indigenous
      communities. The author proposes a new paradigm that integrates Indigenous
      knowledge and perspectives into conservation efforts, creating a more just
      and sustainable approach to protecting natural areas.</p>
    <p>I used this source to support my argument that conservation efforts must
      recognize and respect Indigenous peoples' rights and perspectives. The
      article provided evidence and a theoretical framework for why this is
      important and helped me to articulate the need for a new paradigm in
      conservation that integrates Indigenous knowledge and perspectives.</p> <br>

      America's National Parks (Vol. 21). University of Arizona Press. Chapter 13.</p>
    <p>Chapter 13 of "Cultivating the Imaged Wilderness" explains the
      collaborative management strategies between Native American communities
      and national park agencies in regards to plant resource management. Deur
      and James highlight the pros and cons, including improved communication
      and shared decision-making, and the need for mutual trust and respect in
      successful partnerships.</p>

    <p>Michel Foucault's essay "The Subject and Power" explores the concept of
      power and its relationship to the subject. He argues that power is not
      just something possessed by individuals or groups, but is embedded in
      social relationships and structures. Foucault suggests that power is not
      something that can be seized or given up, but is constantly in flux and
      produced through various social practices and discourses.</p>
    <p>I used Foucault's ideas about power to analyze the ways in which power
      operates in society. Governmentality is used to influence and shape
    conservation efforts in Yosemite National Park, highlighting the complex
  and dynamic nature of power relations between the state, private organizations,
and local communities. By recognizing the pervasive nature of power relations,
we can better understand the challenges and opportunities for promoting sustainable
and equitable outcomes in conservation efforts.</p> <br>

    <p>The National Park Foundation provides information on Yosemite National
      Park, which is located in California's Sierra Nevada mountains. The park
      is known for its stunning natural features, including waterfalls, cliffs,
      and granite domes, as well as its diverse wildlife. Visitors can enjoy a
      variety of activities, such as hiking, camping, rock climbing, and
      skiing. The park also offers educational opportunities for people of all
      ages to learn about the natural history and cultural significance of the
      area.</p>
