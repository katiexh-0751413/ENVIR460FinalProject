    <h2>Power Inbalances and Inequities</h2>
    <p>Through the theoretical framework of Governmentality, I have identified
      several power imbalances and inequities in conservation efforts in
      Yosemite National Park. These power imbalances and inequities arise from
      competing interests, limited resources, and differing conservation goals
      among stakeholders.</p>
    <p>For example, the state's political pressures and budget cuts can impact
      the NPS's ability to effectively manage and preserve the park's
      resources, creating power imbalances in decision-making processes.
      Private organizations may have limited resources or differing
      conservation goals, which can create power imbalances and competing
      interests in decision-making processes. Indigenous communities may face
      power imbalances and inequities in decision-making processes, as their
      voices may be overshadowed by more powerful stakeholders.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, power imbalances and inequities can impact conservation
      efforts' effectiveness, as decision-making processes may prioritize some
      interests over others. For example, if economic growth is prioritized
      over environmental conservation, the park's natural resources may be
      compromised, impacting its long-term preservation and sustainability.</p>
